There is a massive substitution of U.S. dollar assets by gold - a strategy which has earned billions of dollars for the Bank of Russia just within several months, comments Vladimir Miklashevsky, a strategist at Danske Bank.

FM Nirmala Sitharaman  Notwithstanding its acute budget constraints, the government on Friday went the whole hog and unveiled a massive fiscal stimulus of Rs 1.45 lakh crore or 0.7% of the gross domestic product (GDP), mostly in the form of surprise, more-than-asked-for tax cuts for the whole of corporate India. Hitherto, the government has been trying to spur the lethargic economy via easing of credit flows, making loans cheaper and bolstering liquidity across the financial-sector entities, rather than via a potentially hazardous fiscal digression.

With that in mind, our GMV declined to $98 million from $127 million in the same period last year. The main reason for the low GMV was because we had to continue to scale back investments in marketing and inventory, which resulted in the decline in a number of buyers and orders.

GMV contributions from marketplaces in the first half of the year was 62% versus 51% for the same period last year, sorry GMV contribution from marketplaces was 63% this year. The increase is primarily from adding quality merchants to our B2C merchants marketplace because of the declining sales volume, our cost of revenue decreased to $23 million and our gross profit decreased to $8 million.

A key tax deadline is today.Here's how to make sure you don't botch it.Paying quarterly taxes?Sept.is the third deadline for the 2019 tax year.Get the Better newsletter.Got some side income?Run a business?You're facing a tax deadline today.Individuals who pay the Internal Revenue Service every quarter must make their third payment for 2019 by Sept.16.The other deadlines for this year are April 15, June 17 and Jan.15, 2020.or 100 percent of the liability from the prior year.If your adjusted gross income on that year's return exceeded $150,000, then you're on the hook for 110 percent of the tax liability.Though most 9-to-5 employees have these taxes withheld from each paycheck throughout the year, business owners and others who pay quarterly must hash out their estimated income and calculate what their tax load will be.When you calculate estimated tax, you come up for the estimate for the whole year and back out any withholding, said Lisa Featherngill, CPA and member of the American Institute of CPAs' personal financial planning committee.Then you want to make sure that three-quarters of what will be due is paid through September, she said.

All three counties are asking for a 40 percent tax on all non-cigarette tobacco products and a $4 tax on each pack of cigarettes. The taxes would start in 2020, although Pitkin County's cigarette tax would start at $3.20 and increase by 10 cents a year until it reaches $4. These are measures that local public health experts would agree are good steps to help curb tobacco use among youths, and it would be easy to assume that they were initiated by concerned parents, but much of the push, as well as the mostly successful efforts to raise the tobacco purchase age to 21, has come from teens themselves.

The final result for the 2018/19 financial year revealed a modest $700 million deficit - a $13.8 billion improvement on what was predicted when the budget was originally delivered in May 2018. The result was built on the back of lower-than-expected spending on the NDIS, higher personal income tax receipts and strong iron ore exports. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government pulled in $11.5 billion more in receipts than predicted, and handed out $6.6 billion less in payments.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann revealed the coalition had doubled spending on the NDIS, not tripled as it was forecast to do. That saved $4.6 billion in payments, which Senator Cormann said was the result of a slower-than-expected transition of people into the NDIS.

Photo: Creativa - Fotolia  Health insurers must issue refunds to hundreds of thousands of Texas consumers overcharged nearly $92 million for plans purchased last year. The mandate to issue refunds comes under a provision in the Affordable Care Act that limits how much companies can keep for overhead and profit. The bulk of the rebates  -  a total of $80.4 million from four companies -  will go to those who overpaid for plans purchased on the individual market in 2018, according to data from the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The rest, roughly $11.5 million, will be refunded by two insurers to more than 500 large Texas employers who bought plans for their workers last year, the data showed.

Photo: Creativa - Fotolia  Health insurers must issue refunds to hundreds of thousands of Texas consumers overcharged nearly $92 million for plans purchased last year. The mandate to issue refunds comes under a provision in the Affordable Care Act that limits how much companies can keep for overhead and profit. The bulk of the rebates  -  a total of $80.4 million from four companies -  will go to those who overpaid for plans purchased on the individual market in 2018, according to data from the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The rest, roughly $11.5 million, will be refunded by two insurers to more than 500 large Texas employers who bought plans for their workers last year, the data showed.

Nationally, health insurers must repay a record $743 million to more than 2 million over-charged customers on the individual market  -  more than four times what was paid out in rebates last year, the Kaiser study found. While rebates have been issued most years, the 2018 total is noteworthy as it is the largest and points to a significant over-correction from past rate hikes, health economists say. With the benefit of 20-20-hindsight, last year's premiums were indeed overpriced, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Economics  The trade war between the United States and China has plunged global growth to its lowest levels in a decade, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said as it slashed global growth forecasts. The OECD said that the global economy risked entering a new, lasting low-growth phase if governments continued to dither over how to respond. The global economy will see its weakest growth since the financial crisis this year, slowing from 3.6% last year to 2.9% this year before a predicted 3.0% in 2020, the OECD said.

In 2018 and 2019, Fannie Mae FNMA, -1.25% and Freddie FMCC, -2.63% were only allowed to purchase $35 billion in multifamily loans each, however mission-driven loans excluded from the caps brought the total volume to $142.5 billion in 2018. The FHFA began setting caps on Fannie and Freddie's multifamily businesses in 2014 in an effort to support liquidity in the multifamily market while also working to prevent private capital from being crowded out. Beyond expanding the size of the caps, the FHFA also made other revisions to how Fannie and Freddie can conduct their multifamily businesses. In particular, the agency will now require the two firms to have over one third (37.5%) of their multifamily activities be directed toward affordable housing.

The production recorded in July was 60,000 tonne, while it was 46,000 tonne in July 2018. Confronted with a drastic reduction in production during the last few years, the Rubber Board companies procured rain-guard materials like polythene sheets and adhesive in bulk and distributed among small growers.

Contrary to popular perception, only about 18 percent of global goods trade is now driven by labor-cost arbitrage. Three factors explain these changes: growing demand in China and the rest of the developing world, which enables these countries to consume more of what they produce the growth of more comprehensive domestic supply chains in those countries, which has reduced their reliance on imports of intermediate goods and the impact of new technologies.

By 2017, the share of exports was down to 9 percent. This is on a par with the share in the United States but is far lower than the shares in Germany (34 percent), South Korea (28 percent), and Japan (14 percent). This shift has been largely obscured because the country's output, imports, and exports have all been rising so dramatically in absolute terms.

Viola, like 99% of Malawi's rural population, does not have access to electricity, and is entirely dependent on biomass (wood) for her daily cooking requirement. The dependence on biomass for fuel has contributed to rapid deforestation with over reduction in forest cover of more than 30% in less than four decades  -  one of the highest rates of deforestation in Africa. Against this backdrop, in 2013 Malawi committed to an ambitious target of getting two million energy efficient cookstoves into use in households across the country, to replace the traditional open stone fire.

The cantonal tax regimes such as holding company, mixed company, and domicile company are abolished. As a consequence of this abolition, specific transitional rules will be available for companies that will lose their preferential cantonal tax regimes. Hence, during a transition period of 5 years, the realization of hidden reserves (including original goodwill) can be taxed separately with a lower special tax rate of 0.5% if such income would not have been taxable under the old law.

As of January 1, 2021, the corporate income tax rate will be reduced from the current 8% to 7%. As a result, the effective tax burden for an ordinarily taxed company in the canton of Zurich with domicile in the city of Zurich will be reduced from currently 21.1% to 19.1% (federal, cantonal, and community tax calculation based on profit before taxes and current conditions).

Therefore, the maximum cantonal tax relief is set at 70%.  The capital tax on equity relating to investments, patents, and similar intangibles as well as intercompany loans will also be reduced under the Canton Zurich tax reform.

The mandate to issue refunds comes under a provision in the Affordable Care Act that limits how much companies can keep for overhead and profit. The bulk of the rebates  -  a total of $80.4 million from four companies -  will go to those who overpaid for plans purchased on the individual market in 2018, according to data from the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Service analyzed by the Kaiser Family Foundation. The rest, roughly $11.5 million, will be refunded by two insurers to more than 500 large Texas employers who bought plans for their workers last year, the data showed.

Nationally, health insurers must repay a record $743 million to more than 2 million over-charged customers on the individual market  -  more than four times what was paid out in rebates last year, the Kaiser study found. While rebates have been issued most years, the 2018 total is noteworthy as it is the largest and points to a significant over-correction from past rate hikes, health economists say.

Image  Counters at Heraklion Airport on the Greek island of Crete on Monday.CreditStefanos Rapanis/Reuters  Layton Roche and Natalie Wells booked flights more than a year ago from Manchester to Kos, a Greek island, for their Friday wedding, and they said they had been forced to improvise after the collapse turned their plans into chaos.

The couple had already paid about 4,000 pounds, or about $5,000, for alternative flights for themselves and some family members, and they were expecting to spend another £2,000 for their accommodation.

For dividend yield theory I consider the +/- 10% band to be the fair value range for the business in question which in Lockheed Martin's case would be $287-$352. That suggests that shares have possible downside risk of 9%-26%.

Even looking at 13% annualized returns, estimated earnings growth plus the dividend yield, you could still stomach roughly 20% valuation compression to a 15x TTM P/E and still generate 13% annualized returns. That's pretty impressive and due in large part to the forecast growth of earnings.

The ombudsman said the adviser would have been aware Harlequin was the reason Mr and Mrs A sought the new mortgage and would have known the nature of Harlequin as a risky investment. Although the ombudsman service noted the adviser was not giving investment advice, they said the adviser should have thought about how the mortgage was to be repaid and that the nature of the investment should have raised concerns as to the security of the repayment strategy. In this case, Intrinsic Mortgage Planning was ordered to pay the difference between the total cost of the interest-only mortgage and what the total cost of the repayment vehicle would have been  -  plus 8 per cent simple interest per year and £750 for trouble and upset.

The chance to test that theory came in May 2003, when Congress lowered the top rate on long-term capital gains to 15% from 20%. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2005-06 realizations of capital gains had more than doubled - up 151% - from the levels for 2002-03.

ASX-listed Sims Metal has warned escalating trade wars have hit the global demand for scrap metal.Credit:Photographer: Ryan Stuart  Mr Field said while it initially appeared steel mills were managing the lower demand, early this month mills had materially reduced their purchases. At the end of August, the scrap metal price including freight from Turkey, the world's largest scrap metal importer, sat at around $US268 ($389) per tonne. Midway through last week, it had fallen below $US240. This reduction in demand for scrap has driven a steep fall in prices, Mr Field said.

Between 2003 and 2011 the World Bank-funded Copperbelt Environment Project undertook a number of steps to address the lead pollution in Kabwe, though this too was hampered by the lack of a comprehensive remediation program, and therefore achieved only limited results. The project cleaned the Kabwe Canal to reduce the risk of lead recontamination through seasonal flooding, removed mine waste material from some residential areas, and removed topsoil and planted grass and trees in the yards of 3100 households.

As for their separate arguments, Fraser-Jenkins says there are plenty of reasons that the S&P can't go higher than 4,000.

Local government debt heads above 200% of income  Debt levels in councils continues to increase as population pressures, tourism growth, and aging infrastructure come together to form a perfect storm. Comparing total liabilities to operating income is a common way of comparing debt levels among councils and is a similar concept as house-price-to-income ratios.

by Tyler Durden  Sat, 09/14/2019 - 07:35  0  SHARES  A new study published by the International Monetary Fund has found that $15 trillion of the world's foreign direct investments are phantom capital - a term used to describe capital that is designed to minimize tax bills of multinational firms. This total makes up 40% of the world's foreign direct investments, and is the equivalent to the combined GDP of China and Germany, according to Bloomberg.

Here's the statement: Thomas Cook UK Plc and associated UK entities have entered Compulsory Liquidation and are now under the control of the Official Receiver. It's important to note that a Compulsory Liquidation means that the situation is terminal, unlike Company Administration, which is intended to give space and time for potential business rescue and recovery so that the company can avoid insolvency. This will be distressing and inconvenient for travellers (600,000 worldwide, of whom 150,000 are British citizens, including at least one close friend of mine) but they'll get home eventually and carry on with their lives as before.
